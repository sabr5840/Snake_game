## Introduction
Welcome to Snake Game! This is a classic arcade game where you control a snake roaming around the game board, consuming food pellets to grow longer. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or your snake's own body.

## How to Play
- **Controls:** Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to direct the snake: up, down, left, and right.
- **Gameplay:** The snake will continue moving in the chosen direction until it hits a wall or its own body.
- **Scoring:** Each food pellet consumed adds to your score and increases the length of your snake.
- **Game Over:** The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
- **Pause:** Click the "Pause Game" button to pause the game. Click it again to resume.
